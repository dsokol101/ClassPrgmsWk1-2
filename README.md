# Week 1–2 C++ Programs

This folder contains example C++ programs used during the **first two weeks of the course**.  
These programs introduce basic C++ syntax, data types, and simple input/output.

## Files

- `hello_world.cpp`  
  A first C++ program demonstrating program structure and basic output using `cout`.

- `built_in_types.cpp`  
  Examples of built-in data types such as `int`, `double`, and `char`, along with simple variable usage.

- `simple.cpp`  
  The definition (i.e. full code) of a function called simple. We demonstrated separate compilation, followed by linkage.

- `arrays.cpp`  
  An introduction to arrays, including declaration, initialization, and basic access.

## How to Compile and Run

Use a C++ compiler such as `g++`.

Example:
```bash
g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello
./hello
